uparma-lib: Lookup library for parameters used in Proteomics tools
==================================================================

Proteomics is supported by a wide variety of tools. Unfortunately there is
no standardized parameter set, thus evaluating a group of tools that tackle the
same problem becomes cumbersome as the parameters have to be translated.

The Universal Parameter Mapper Project addresses this problem by offering a
standard independent mapping between different styles.


APIs
----

Currently the following API exist
- [Python](https://github.com/uparma/uparma-py)
- ...


Rules
------
- All styles have to have a reference to the original work
- Each engine version can only be associated to one translation style
