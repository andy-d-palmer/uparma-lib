==================================================================

Proteomics is supported by a wide variety of tools. Unfortunately there is
no standardized parameter set, thus evaluating a group of tools that tackle the
same problem becomes cumbersome as the parameters have to be translated.

The Universal Parameter Mapper Project addresses this problem by offering a
standard independent mappings between different styles.
